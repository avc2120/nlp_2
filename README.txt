1b. Dependency Graphs are projective if there are no crossing links. In other words, the dependency graphs do not intersect. Non-projective dependencies arise with scrambling of words, extraposition(the TA is coming who is wearing a hat), and topicalization (Cheese, I thought he likes). Thus, non-projective dependency graphs cannot be represented by Context Free Grammar.
1c. Projective: I went to the beach today.
Non-projective: An interview was scheduled on the 21st of April.
