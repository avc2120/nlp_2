1b. Dependency Graphs are projective if there are no crossing links. In other words, the dependency graphs do not intersect. Non-projective dependencies arise with scrambling of words, extraposition(the TA is coming who is wearing a hat), and topicalization (Cheese, I thought he likes). Thus, non-projective dependency graphs cannot be represented by Context Free Grammar. For any k between points a and b there cannot exist a parent or child of k outside of a and b.
1c. Projective: I went to the beach today.
Non-projective: An interview was scheduled on the 21st of April.i

2b.
The unlabeled attachment score of is 0.229038040231 and the labeled attachment score is 0.125473013344. This means that for UAS only 22.9% of the worsd parsed were tagged with the correct heads and only 12.5% of the LAS tokens were tagged with the correct heads and labels. Thus, badfeatures.model is not a good model.

3. Check informative checks that each of the featuers is not a 'None' type, an empty string and an underscore.  And Find_left_right_dependencies finds the leftmost and rightmost dependencies by comparing the indices of the items in the arcs. And lastly extract features extracts the features  to improve the performance of your feature.
